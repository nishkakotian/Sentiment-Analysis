",NEGATIVE
" THE ANGSTY TOO ANGSTY MOMENTS WITHDRAWN OUT TO THE MAX AS FAR AS THAY CAN GO
",NEGATIVE
"AND THE SCRIPT IT LEFT ALL THE KEY PLOTS AND EMOTION FROM THE CHARACTERS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DIALOGUE
",POSITIVE
" I THINK IT WAS EMPIRE MAGAZINES REVIEW OF NEW MOON THAT SAID THAT KRISTEN RELIED HEAVILY ON THE TACTIC OF TACTIC OF BLINKING A LOT WHICH SHE REALLY DOES DO A LOT

",POSITIVE
" I I SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT YOU KNOW
",POSITIVE
" I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT TO COME OUT JUST JUMP OUT ANY TIME AND SAY ITS A PARADOX
",NEGATIVE
" NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSFUL PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERS THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE
",NEGATIVE
"WHICH KIND OF JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IF YOUVE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY IN A FEDORA TO JUST TELL YOU OH YES WE ARE THE ADJUSTEMENT BUREAU AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO YOU KNOW ITS JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE

",NEGATIVE
"JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO WATCH WHILE I WAS FALLING ASLEEP 
",NEGATIVE
"SO I DIDNT DIDNT HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE 
",NEGATIVE
"AND I UM PRETTY MUCH IT PRETTY MUCH MET MY LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MOST PART
",NEGATIVE
"BECAUSE I THREE MAJOR COMPLAINTS I HAVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE
",NEGATIVE

",NEGATIVE
"IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE YOU YOURE GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED
",NEGATIVE
"BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A CARTOON WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH MOSTLY IS WITH ALL THE CGI FX
",NEGATIVE
"AND AND THERE IS A LOT OF IT 
",NEGATIVE
"I MEAN ITS ITS ABOUT THAT LEVEL STAR WAR IS 
",POSITIVE
"PRETTY CLOSE AS FAR AS JUST CGI HEAVY LIKE THIS TIME ITS WHAT ITS LIKE HUMAN FACE AND EVERYTHING AROUND THAT FACE IS CARTOON CGI COMPUTER EFFECTS
