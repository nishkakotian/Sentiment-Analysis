",NEGATIVE
" I LIKE TO TEASE SOME MYSTERY AND GREAT PLOT WHAT COULDVE BEEN BUT THAN ALL IS EXPLAINED AND DISPPEARES TEN MINUTES LATER ITS JUST A CLEAR REMAKE OF PREDATOR FROM BACK IN 1997 WITH THE PREMISE BEING ALMOST IDENTICAL
",NEGATIVE
"ALTHOUGHT WHAT WASNT THE SAME WAS THE CONNECTION TO EACH OTHER WHICH FIRST MOVIE HAD AND THIS ONE NOT
",NEGATIVE
" IN THE FIRST RUN THEY WERE A TEAM AND THEY WORKED TOGETHER AND YOU SEE THE PERSONALITES THIS MOVIE JUST POPS A GROUP OF DIFFERENT KILLERS DOWN TOGETHER AND LETS THEM INTERACT POORLY

" OF THE ACTING NOTHING STANDS OUT A SPECTACULAR WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED OF THE MOVIE LIKE THIS
",NEGATIVE
"BUT NOTHING SUCKS EITHER WHICH GAINS THE MOVIE SOME POINTS I GUESS
",POSITIVE
"WHAT DISAPPOINTED ME WAS THAT ONE OF THE MOST HYPED ACTORS IN THE MOVIE WAS ONLY IN THERE FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME

",NEGATIVE
"ITS A POINTLESS SCENE FOR THE AUDIENCE AND THE CHARACTERS
",NEGATIVE
"IT DOSENT GIVE AN GIVE ANY INSIGHT OR HELP ITS JUST MAKE THEM SEEM LIKE SHE SA SHE SAW THE FIRST MOVIE
