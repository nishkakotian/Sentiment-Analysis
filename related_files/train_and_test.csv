"I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WOUDLNT HAVE INSERTED THE HUMOR INTO THIS MOVIE IT WOULDVE BEEN JUST TOO SERIOUS AND KIND OF BORING IN A SENSE 
",POSITIVE
" BUT THE HUMOR REALLY JUST NAILED IT
",POSITIVE
"AND THE ACTION SEQUENCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE TENSED
",POSITIVE
"I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE DO THIS
",POSITIVE
" WHEN THEY JUST COME UP WITH THESE TOTALLY COMPLETELY NEW STYLIZED WAYS OF DEVELOPING ACTION SEQUENCES
",POSITIVE
"COZ SURE ITS FUN TO SEE A SUPER HERO GO ROUND AND KICK BAD GUY BUTT YOU KNOW PUNCH KICK WHATEVER BAM 
",POSITIVE
"BUT WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO INTERPRET THIS 
",NEGATIVE
"AND ADD SOMETHING LIKE AN EXTRA SPARK IN THERE
",POSITIVE
"THAT MAKES IT MORE VISUALLY TRULY APPEALING
",POSITIVE
"AND JUST DIFFERENT 
",POSITIVE
"IT ENGAGES THE AUDIENCE MORE
",POSITIVE

",POSITIVE
" BUT THEY TOOK A NEW SPIN ON IT
",POSITIVE
"AND I JUST LOVED IT
",POSITIVE
" AND I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH THE FIGHTING SEQUENCES WERE A LITTLE BIT LONG IN SOME PLACES T
",NEGATIVE
"SO I MEANT IF I WAS WEARING 3D GLASSES AND WAS SEEING THIS IN 3D I WOULDVE ENJOYED IT A LOT MORE 
",NEGATIVE
" AND I WOULD WANT THE SEQUENCES TO BE EVEN LONGER RATHER THAN SHORTER
",POSITIVE

" HE CARRIED IT
",POSITIVE
"WHICH IS A SMART MOVE SINCE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE REAL COMIC BOOK FAN TO GET WHAT HES NAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE
",POSITIVE
" UM I ACTUALLY THINK THAT LIEV SCHREIBER IS A GOOD ACTOR
",POSITIVE
"AND HE ALMOST LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THIS CHARACTER IN DEFIANCE
",POSITIVE
" I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE OFF THE COSTUME OR SOMETHING
",NEGATIVE
"NOW OTHER PERFORMANCES ARE BORDERLINE
",NEGATIVE
" OK BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEADPOOL AND GAMBIT
",POSITIVE
" ACTUALLY I LIKED HIM A LOT
",POSITIVE
" AND I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEAD POOR CHARACTER
",POSITIVE
" NOW HES SEEN AT THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY SOLD ME
",POSITIVE
"I MEAN THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE 
",POSITIVE
"I LIKED THAT SCENE WHERE HE HAD A SWORDS IN THERE AND THERES BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA SHOOT HIM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM TAKE HIM DOWN TAKE HIM DOWN BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM TAKE THAT WITH MY MAGICAL SWORDS 
",POSITIVE
"BUT FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT FEEL LIKE IT

"IT REMINDED ME OF GETTING UP ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND EATING FRUIT LOOPS AND UM WATCHING CARTOONS
",POSITIVE
" BUT YOU KNOW FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT CARE
",NEGATIVE
"UM I SAW NO REASON WHY THEY NEEDED TO BRING BACK THE VILLAIN FROM THE FIRST ONE

",POSITIVE
"BUT OTHERWISE I DONT KNOW
",NEGATIVE
" I DIDNT EVEN CARE FOR IT
",NEGATIVE
"AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE AVERAGE
",NEGATIVE
" LETS FACE IT THEY ARE REALLY NOT MASTER PIECES
",NEGATIVE
"I THOUGHT TWILIGHT DIRECTED BY CATHERINE HARDWICKE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY RATHER ENJOYABLE
",POSITIVE
"UM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT HAD ITS FLAWS
",NEGATIVE
" BUT CINEMATICLY I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD QUITE GOOD
",POSITIVE
" IT WASIT WAS ENJOYABLE
",POSITIVE
"I WASNT THINKING ON HEARING THAT CHRIS WEITZ WAS GONNA START THE NEW MOON BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT WAS PHILLIP PULLMAN THE GOLDEN COMPASS
",NEGATIVE
"I THOUGHT THAT FILM WAS AWFUL

"AND I I DIDINT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM NEW MOON UM IN TERMS OF HIS DIRECTION
",NEGATIVE
"OVERALL NEW MOON WAS IT WAS OK JUST AVERAGE
",POSITIVE
" THE THING IS ITS A VERY GOOD TRANSLATION OF THE BOOK
",POSITIVE
" ITS VERY VERY LOYAL TO THE BOOK 
",POSITIVE
"AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LOYALTY
",POSITIVE
"UM HOWEVER IT IS THIS LOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE THAT GIVES IT ITS FLAWS
",NEGATIVE
"AND THE BOOK IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK EVER
",NEGATIVE
" I MEAN THE ENTIRE XXX IS BELLA SWAN KRISTEN KRISTENS STEWARDS CHARACTER MOBBING AROUND COMPLETELY DEPRESSED
",NEGATIVE
" IT WASNT REALLY THE BEST THE MOST THRILLING READ EVER ILL SAY THAT
",NEGATIVE
"SO OVERALLNEW MOON EVEN WITH THE BIGGER BETTER BUDGETS HUH IT WAS STILL TOO LONG 
",NEGATIVE
" THE ANGSTY TOO ANGSTY MOMENTS WITHDRAWN OUT TO THE MAX AS FAR AS THAY CAN GO
",NEGATIVE
"AND THE SCRIPT IT LEFT ALL THE KEY PLOTS AND EMOTION FROM THE CHARACTERS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DIALOGUE
",POSITIVE
" I THINK IT WAS EMPIRE MAGAZINES REVIEW OF NEW MOON THAT SAID THAT KRISTEN RELIED HEAVILY ON THE TACTIC OF TACTIC OF BLINKING A LOT WHICH SHE REALLY DOES DO A LOT
",NEGATIVE
"BUT AT THE SAME GOES FOR ROB PATTINSON AS EDWARD AND TAYLOR LAUTNER AS JACOB THEY DO A LOT OF FROWNING IM A MANLY MAN AND I FROWN
",NEGATIVE
"FOR THE MOMENT IN THIS THE WHOLE CINEMA WAS LAUGHTING
",POSITIVE
"AND YOU KNEW YOU SHOULDNT BE LAUGHING

" MY FAVORITE SCENE WOULD DEFINATELY BE THE VOLTURI
",POSITIVE
" UM THEN MY WINS ON SCREEN WISKERS I MEAN THEY WERE REALLY WORN IN A LOTS WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THOUGHT XXX REALLY RATHER GOOD 
",NEGATIVE
"AND UM MICHAEL SHEEN AS ARO AS WELL HE WAS RATHER ENJOYABLE TO WATCH
",POSITIVE
" AND I THINK THE VOLTURI THAT WAS MY EXCITING BIT OF THE ENTIRE FILM
",POSITIVE
"THE REST OF THE FILM WAS JUST WATCHING KRISTEN JUST MOB AROUND 
",NEGATIVE
"AND THAT WAS REALLY BORING
",NEGATIVE
" BEFORE I WENT IN TO SEE THE GREEN LANTERN IVE BEEN HEARING ALL THESE LIKE CRITICS BASICALLY JUST TRASHING THIS MOVIE LEFT AND RIGHT

",NEGATIVE
"BECAUSE I THINK WHY NOT JUST MAKE THIS YOU KNOW MOVIE THIS LIVE ACTION MOVIE AND TALK CARTOON
",NEGATIVE
"THATS REALLY THE ROUTE THAT YOURE GONNA GO 
",POSITIVE
" BUT I THINK THERE WAS ALSO SOME SORT OF LIKE UM TONE WITHIN THE ACTUAL UM POWERS OF THE GREEN LANTERN AND HIMSELF AND THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY THINK UP OF ANYTHING AND YOU CAN PROJECT THAT INTO THE REAL LIFE 
",POSITIVE
"AND I THINK HAVING THIS SORT OF SUPERPOWER ALMOST THIS POWER TO JUST IMAGINE ANYTHING KIND OF JUST UM HELPED ME GET PASSED THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL CGI CHARACTERS AND SET
",POSITIVE
"THIS IS A PLAYGROUND AND THEIR IMAGINARY PLAYGROUND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ANYTHING THAT WHAT ALSO MADE THE FILM EXCITING
",POSITIVE
"BECAUSE YOU DONT ENTIRELY KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT
",POSITIVE
"BUT THEN YOU KIND OF LIKE WALK OUT OF THE MOVIE AND YOURE LIKE WELL I I GET WHAT HAPPENED I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED
",NEGATIVE
"BUT WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR GREEN LANTERN MOVIE 2 THAT WOULD BE EVEN LIKE WORTH WHILE NOW 
",NEGATIVE
"AND IT DOES KIND OF A LEA HELPS ALLEVIATE WHAT THAT WHOLE WAS IS ABOUT FIGHTING THE ULTIMATE ENEMY WITHIN THIS FIRST MOVIE AND THAT THE THREAT IS STILL THERE POTENTIALLY SPEAKING

" LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER IS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE DIDNT THINK THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY AT ALL
",NEGATIVE
" I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY S KIND OF SCARY

",NEGATIVE
" UM I JUST DIDNT THINK IT WAS WELL DEVELOPED ENOUGH AND UM I ALSO I I INCLUDE IN THAT LAURENCE FISHBURNES CHARACTER AS WELL 
",NEGATIVE
"WHO I THINK RODRIGEZ WHEN HE WROTE THE MO WROTE THE MOVIE WAS GOING FOR A MARLON BRANDO APOCALIPSE NOW TYPE OF CHARACTER
",NEGATIVE
" BUT HE ACTUALLY FOUND UM WHEN HES SEEN COME UP IT SLOWED THE MOVIE DOWN UM AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM UM WITH PREDATOR TO PREDATORS COMPARED TO PREDATOR
",NEGATIVE
"PREDATOR IS REALLY WELL PACED MOVIE
",POSITIVE
"AND IT PICKS UP SPEED AND NEVER LETS GO EV EVEN IN THE SAME XXX WHERE THEY THEY SLOW YOU KNOW THEY MEANT TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE AND AND TALK ABOUT WHATS GOING ON YO YOU KNOW 
",POSITIVE
"IT FELT THE MOVIE SLOWED DOWN WHERES IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

",NEGATIVE
" THANKS A LOT COMMERCIAL
",NEGATIVE
"THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING IT TO INCEPTION
",NEGATIVE
"BUT I MUST SAY THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAS A CHANCE
",POSITIVE
" I I SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT YOU KNOW
",POSITIVE
" I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT TO COME OUT JUST JUMP OUT ANY TIME AND SAY ITS A PARADOX
",NEGATIVE
" NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSFUL PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERS THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE
",NEGATIVE
"WHICH KIND OF JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IF YOUVE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY IN A FEDORA TO JUST TELL YOU OH YES WE ARE THE ADJUSTEMENT BUREAU AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO YOU KNOW ITS JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE

"BUT HES JUST THE CREEPIEST OLD GUY YOULL EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE HE STANDS OVER PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE ASLEEP JUST STARING AT THEM
",NEGATIVE
" AND UM I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS WATCHING THIS I PURPOSLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE STUPID THAT I COULD FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF AND NOT MISS TOO MUCH
",NEGATIVE
"JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO WATCH WHILE I WAS FALLING ASLEEP 
",NEGATIVE
"SO I DIDNT DIDNT HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE 
",NEGATIVE
"AND I UM PRETTY MUCH IT PRETTY MUCH MET MY LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MOST PART
",NEGATIVE
"BECAUSE I THREE MAJOR COMPLAINTS I HAVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE
",NEGATIVE
"UM BIGGEST ONE IS THE CGI EFFECTS WERE JUST TERRIBLE 
",NEGATIVE

",NEGATIVE
"I MEAN ITS ITS ABOUT THAT LEVEL STAR WAR IS 
",POSITIVE
"PRETTY CLOSE AS FAR AS JUST CGI HEAVY LIKE THIS TIME ITS WHAT ITS LIKE HUMAN FACE AND EVERYTHING AROUND THAT FACE IS CARTOON CGI COMPUTER EFFECTS
